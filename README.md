# Relay

## Client Information

This is the web version of the Relay client; other models, such as CLI/Godot, can be found on the other branches

You do not need to use this client, it is just the official distribution:

You are free to develop/install a custom client, however we cannot ensure the safety of modified distributions, so use them at your own discretion
